# Introduction

Maintenance of variation in populations.

Alternative reproductive tactics as stable polymorphisms,

\- often maintained through frequency-dependent selection

\- possibly resolves sexual conflict

Genetic basis of alternative reproductive tactics shows that there is
some propensity for these to be grouped together into supergenes.

But, we don't know which came first, and to what extent genetic
architecture determines the evolution of alternative reproductive
tactics. Therefore, we used simulation models to understand this.

# Methods

Our model focusses on a single population of diploid males and females
with non-overlapping generations. We model two independent traits,
courtship and parental care, both of which are expressed only in males,
but are also inherited by females. As such, males are one of four
morphs: courter/parents; courter/non-parents; non-courters/parents; or
non-courters/non-parents. The model is inspired by fish species like the
ocellated wrasse, *Symphodus ocellatus*, and as such we will use
terminology appropriate to that species. Nonetheless, our model can be
generalized to any species in which one sex (but not the other) has two
traits that impact mating success and the survival of their offspring.

Each generation has three distinct phases: (1) mate choice and
fertilization; (2) parental care; and (3) viability selection. In the
mate choice phase of the model, females always prefer to mate with males
displaying the courtship trait. If a female decides to mate with a male,
he receives all of her eggs to care for. The male is not guaranteed
paternity of his mates' entire brood, however, because non-courting
males are able to fertilize a proportion of the eggs. The chosen parent
does receive first-male priority. The consequences of this setup are
that the only mechanism by which non-courters can produce offspring is
through these sneak fertilizations. In the parental care phase of the
model, males with the parental care trait have 100% nest survival while
males without the parental care trait have 0% nest survival, independent
of the male's courtship trait. Consequently, non-parents will only be
sustained in the population by sneaking fertilizations in the parental
males' nests. Finally, viability selection is imposed on offspring as
they mature to adulthood, such that males carrying the courtship trait
and/or the parental care trait have a lower probability of survival than
females and males without either courtship or parenting. Males who are
both courters and parents have a multiplicative effect of viability
selection. **Who is allowed to sneak?**

We implemented our model first as a mathematical model and then as an
individual-based simulation model. The purpose of the mathematical model
was to generate baseline predictions for when multiple morphs are
maintained.

## Frequency-dependent population dynamics model

In the mathematical model, we model the proportion of the population
that belong to morphs at each stage of the lifecycle (Fig.
\@ref(fig:mathModel)). In the first stage, we consider the proportion of
the population's nests that will be allocated to each morph. The maximum
number of nests that could be laid is proportional to the number of
males in the population ($N_m$), if each male has the same likelihood of
attracting a female to deposit eggs with him. However, in our model,
males are not equally likely to be chosen by females, and therefore the
maximum number of nests is scaled by the probability of females mating
with each type of male morph. In the case of our model, the total number
of nests laid in the population becomes $$
\frac{N_f}{N_mf_{CP}+N_m f_{CNp}}
$$ because we have constrained females to only mate with courting males.

```{r mathModel, fig.cap="Diagram of the mathematical model describing the inheritance of alternative male reproductive morphs given courtship and parenting traits."}
knitr::include_graphics("../figs/frequency_dependence.png")
```

Likewise, the proportion of nests each type of male receives (${p_n}_M$)
is determined by the number of morphs in the population ($N_mf_M$ for
the $M$ morph), the probability of a female choosing that morph
(${w_s}_M$), and the ratio of the number of nests to the number of
females ($n/N_f$).

Within a given nest, the offspring could either be fertilized by the
nest-holding male or other males sneaking fertilizations. Therefore,
each morph has a proportion of eggs fertilized within their own nests
(${p_{fn}}_M$) and a proportion of eggs fertilized in other males' nests
(${p_{fs}}_M$). These proportions were determined by the sperm
competition coefficient, $c$, which penalized non-courting males, and
the relative reproductive investment for that morph ($r_M$).
Analogously, the proportion of offspring in a nest surviving due to
parental care investment can be split into the proportion surviving in a
male's own nest (${p_{sn}}_M$) or in another male's nest (${p_{ss}}_M$),
which is simply the proportions from the fertilization step weighted by
the probability of the nest surviving if the morph is a parent ($w_n=1$)
or of the morph is a non-parent ($w_n=0$). These proportions
(${p_{sn}}_M$ and ${p_{ss}}_M$) are summed to determine the the overall
proportion of embryos in the population that survive the parenting phase
in each morph's nests (${p_s}_M$).

The final stage of the lifecycle is for offspring surviving in the nest
to undergo viability selection by multiplying the viability selection
coefficient (${w_v}_M$) by the surviving proportion (${p_s}_M$) and the
original frequency of the morph in the population (**Note: does pv need
the frequency multiplication??)**. Finally, the frequency of each morph
in the next generation was calculated by dividing the surviving
proportion (${p_v}_M$ by the sum of all proportions.

To evaluate the outcomes of this mathematical model, we iterated forward
in time for 100 generations from XX combinations of initial morph
frequencies and repeated those iterations across XX values for the sperm
competition coefficient ($c$ = {0..1}) and XX values for the relative
reproductive coefficient ($r_M$ = {0...1}). The iterations were
implemented in R v. 4.1.1 [@rcoreteam2021] using some features of tidyR
[@wickham2021]. To facilitate visualisation of the results, we
calculated the Shannon's diversity index for the morphs remaining in the
100th generation using the R package vegan [@oksanen2015]. We then
visualised the diversity of the population using contour plots produced
by plotly [@sievert2020] in a shiny app that relies on R packages shiny
[@chang2021], shinydashboard [@chang2018], rsconnect [@mcpherson2021],
dplyr [@wickham2021], and rmarkdown [@allaire2021; @xie2020; @xie2018].
