## Extended results of the baseline analytical model

We used the analytical model to identify regions of parameter space that resulted in diversity (i.e., multiple morphs being maintained). We used the Shannon-Wiener diversity index to quantify diversity in the analytical model output and visualised the results in a contour plot (Fig. \@ref(fig:mathParams)), which shows diversity along various relative reproductive investments (x-axis) and sperm competition coefficients (y-axis) for five different number of sneakers allowed. 

```{r getMathResults}
results<-readRDS("../morph_predictions/morph_results_10000_equalStart.RDS")

## Impacts of mating system on the model {#mating-system-results}

We tested the sensitivity of the single-locus model to the strict assumptions of the monogamous mating system. In all models, females were restricted to mate with a single male. First, we relaxed the constraint that females failed to mate if no acceptable male was chosen, and instead allowed females deposit their eggs with a randomly-selected unmated
male in the population should they fail to find a preferred mate
('monogamy + random'). Next we allowed males to be chosen by multiple females, with females who failed to find a preferred mate not being able to produce offspring ('polygyny'). Finally, we allowed males to be chosen y multiple females but allowed females to mate with a randomly-selected unmated male in the
population should they fail to find a preferred mate ('polygyny + random'). 

As expected, in the low diversity parameter space, the majority of
simulations resulted in fixation or near-fixation of the courter/parent
morph, regardless of mating system (Fig. \@ref(fig:MatingTypesFig)). A more surprising result was the
inconsistency of results from the mating systems within the the high
diversity parameter space. Only the case most similar to the
mathematical model -- monogamy -- resulted in
polymorphism, with the courter/parent morph coexisting with either the
non-courter/parent or the non-courter/non-parent morph (Fig.
\@ref(fig:MatingTypesFig)). Both polygyny and 'polygyny + random' resulted in the fixation of the
courter/parent morph, and 'monogamy + random' resulted in the fixation of the
non-courter/parent morph in every case. These results can be explained
by the nature of density-dependent survival in the individual-based
model that are not consistent with the mathematical model; in the
simulation model, offspring are created in proportion to the surviving
offspring after mating has occurred, increasing the males' reproductive
success above their specified reproductive investments. This
proportional survival allows males to escape the costs and increase
their reproductive success beyond what is possible in the mathematical
model. Random mating if non-preferred males are unable to be found also
enables non-courter/parents to have increased reproductive success
compared the the mathematical model predictions, which is why they are
fixed in the monogamy case. If stricter costs on courting males are
imposed, specifying $r=0.25$, meaning that $r_{courter}=2$ and
$r_{non-courter}=8$, the scenarios without random mating do result in
the maintenance of 2 or 3 morphs in most cases for both monogamy and
polygyny (Fig. \@ref(fig:MatingTypesFig)), as expected.

```{r MatingTypesFig, fig.cap="Ternary diagrams showing the frequencies of morphs in the final generation of simulation runs with a single gene underlying each trait for parameters expected to yield low diversity (top row) and high diversity (bottom row). Points falling at the corners shows where a single morph was retained; along edges of the triangle represent cases where two morphs were retained; and in the centre are cases where three morphs were retained. Point shapes reflect sets of simulation runs that were initiated with identical starting conditions.", out.width="96%"}

knitr::include_graphics("../figs/matingSystemsTernary-1.png")

```

Regardless of the mating strategies, stochasticity impacted model results, even if replicates were initialised with identical starting conditions (Fig. \@ref(fig:SingleLocusReplicates)). Replicates initialised with identical starting conditions (i.e., identical frequencies of each morph) resulted in different morphs being retained in the simulations.  

```{r SingleLocusReplicates, fig.cap="Stochastic processes during the course of simulations created different outcomes for iterations that start with identical conditions. Each ternary diagram shows one set of simulations that were initiated identically.", out.width="96%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../figs/SingleLocusReplicates-1.png")

```


## Selection on courter and parent traits

We compared lifetime reproductive success across male morphs to
determine whether balancing selection is the primary factor maintaining
variation. We found that in the high diversity parameter sets -- when
two morphs are maintained at high frequencies -- that the retained
morphs tend to have relatively equal lifetime reproductive success in
the final generation of the model (Fig. \@ref(fig:balacingSelection)).
In the low diversity parameter sets, if multiple morphs are found, the
others are at low frequency compared to the high frequency CP morph, and
have substantially lower lifetime reproductive success. These patterns
are indicative of balancing selection favouring the maintenance of two
or more morphs, even after selection has been relaxed on each trait
individually.

```{r balacingSelection, fig.cap="Plots of average lifetime reproductive success (and SEM) for each male morph in each replicate in the final generation of the simulations. The lines connect points from within a replicate. Point size reflects the frequency of that morph in the replicate. These graphs show that the high diversity scenarios generally maintain a stable polymorphism of two or more morphs at high frequency due to balancing selection (i.e., equivalent fitness of morphs). The low diversity scenarios occasionally have low frequencies of other morphs, but they tend to be the result of recombination and not balancing selection (i.e., their fitnesses are substantially lower than the high frequency CP morph)."}
knitr::include_graphics("../figs/fitnessPlots-1.png")
```

Although selection is built into the model, if the population becomes
fixed for specific morphs -- and specific genotypes -- selection might
not be able to act due to a lack of variation. To investigate the
dynamics of selection over the course of each simulation (12,000
generations total), selection gradients on the courter trait and parent
trait (both the binary variable of courter/non-courter and
parent/non-parent) were estimated as the slope of a linear regression of
lifetime reproductive success on each trait value in generation 0 and in
generation 12,000. These patterns of selection were compared across
genetic architectures and parameter settings. Furthermore, we looked at
patterns of lifetime reproductive success across morphs within each
simulation in the final generation to evaluate whether balancing
selection contributed to morph diversity.

Specifically, we
estimated selection gradients for the courter and parental traits in the
first and last generations of the simulations. Selection consistently
favoured parent traits, whereas courter traits could experience negative
selection in high diversity parameter scenarios (Fig.
\@ref(fig:selectionGradients)). Selection was strong in the first
generation, but by generation 12000 selection was substantially relaxed
on one or the other trait, in most cases. A number of the low diversity
replicates resulted in highly correlated selection on courters and
parents, with a number of points falling on the positive 1:1 line (Fig.
\@ref(fig:selectionGradients)).


```{r seldat}
seldat<-readRDS("selection_gradients.RDS")
seldat<-seldat[grep("monogamy_nm",names(seldat))]
```
```{r selectionGradients, fig.height=4, fig.width=7, fig.cap="Selection gradients on parent and courter traits differ across the scenarios of our simulation model. In the first generation, selection always favours the parent trait, but selection gradients on the courter trait can be negative under parameter settings that favoured high diversity. By the end of the simulations (generation 12000), selection has been relaxed, so that selection on the parent trait is often near zero, as is selection on the courter trait. In some cases, the selection gradients on courter and parent traits are correlated at this final generation, especially in low diversity scenarios with QTLs as the genetic architecture. Solid grey lines show the x- and y-axes, with dotted grey lines showing the one-to-one correlation lines."}

## Examining representative examples 

To better understand the factors impacting the model outcomes, here we show some representative examples of both a model with genomewide QTLs and a model with QTLs arranged in a supergene. First, to investigate the genetic diversity retained at the QTLs, we can inspect gentoype plots, where each male in the final generations has his genotype visualised at each QTL locus (Fig. \@ref(fig:exampleGenotypes)). These plots demonstrate the extensive genetic diversity retained in the populations after 10,000 generations.

## Distributions of significance of genome-wide summary statistics

We looked into the distribution of population genetics statistics across many models to summarise patterns (in the main text), but we also tested these for statistical significance. The distributions of p-values for the observed heterozygosity and Tajima's D, as calculated using vcftools, are shown in Fig. \@ref(fig:genomewideDiv). 
Further, we looked to identify whether causal QTLs ('true' QTLs) were found in regions of the genome with significant $G_{ST}$ values, so we identified regions with peaks in $G_{ST}$ and evaluated whether those peaks contained a causal locus. The genomewide patterns of the proportions of all true QTLs that were found in these peaks is found in Fig. \@ref(fig:GstProportions). Linkage disequilibrium was similarly not found to vary substantially among causal vs marker loci nor between genetic architectures (Fig. \@ref(fig:LDplots)).

## Genome-wide association studies have high false positive rates

As reported in the main text, we performed genome-wide association studies of our simulated genotypes to identify SNPs that could be statistically associated with either the courter or the parent trait. We then detected the proportion of true positives (proportion of causal QTLs correctly associated with trait values) and false positives (the proportion of detected SNPs that were NOT true QTLs), and found that there here high false positive rates and generall low probabilities of correct detection of loci (Fig. \@ref(fig:GWASoutcomes)).
