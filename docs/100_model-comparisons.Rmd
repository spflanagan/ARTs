The purpose of this model is to understand how genetic architectures of alternative reproductive tactics impact their maintenance in populations. I'm using an individual-based simulation model with different selection scenarios, types of alternative tactics, and genetic architectures (genome-wide additive genetic variance, supergenes, expression networks). To explore the parameter space, I'm also using a mathematical model without the genetic architectures to identify regions of parameter space where we expect multiple morphs to be maintained.

## Overview of the simulation model 

Males can be courters or not-courters and parents or not-parents. When the model is run with both traits, this results in four possible morphs: courter/parent, courter/not-parent, not-courter/parent, and not-courter/not-parent. Generations are non-overlapping and there is one reproductive bout per generation. In each generation, the population follows the following timeline: 

![Flowchart of simulation](../figs/simulation_flowchart_densitydependent.png)

Each step is explained in further detail below. 

\newpage

### 1. Choosing a nest

A female samples 50 males and chooses a male to nest with based on his courtship trait. If there are no courtship traits in the model, she chooses based on the male's parental trait. If she does not encounter an acceptable male, she nests with a randomly chosen male. If she encounters multiple equally-acceptable males, she either randomly selects a male from the population or does not mate, depending on the chosen parameter settings.  

### 2. Fertilization

Once a female decides to nest, up to three males can fertilize the nest. Courting males contribute a different amount of sperm than non-courting. The male with whom the female is nesting gets $r_{courter}/\Sigma{n_{sperm}}$ and additional non-courting males (up to 2) get $(r_{non-courter}*0.5/\Sigma{n_{sperm}})$, where $\Sigma{n_{sperm}}$ is the total number of sperm contributed by all of the males, weighted by the sperm competition factor (0.5 is the default for all males except the chosen male). So, when a female mates with one courter and two non-courters, $\Sigma{n_{sperm}}$ = $r_{courter}$ + 2$*$(0.5$*$$r_{non-courter}$). In these runs, males who are courters cannot sneak fertilizations. Every time a male mates he uses his sperm, so if after one mating a male fertilizes 2 eggs, he only has $n_{sperm}-2$ sperm for his next mating. 


### 3. Nest Survival

Before the offspring can survive, the nest has to survive. This step is only relevant when parental traits are in the model - if only the courtship trait is specified, then all progeny in the nest survive at this point. When males have the parental trait, if the female has given eggs to a non-parental male (because she chose based on courtship traits), then the nest has a 0% chance of surviving. If the female has given eggs to a parental male, the nest has a 100% chance of surviving. 

### 4. Density-dependent survival

Once the identities of the surviving nests are known--along with the identities of the parents, including sneaker parents--the offspring are created in the simulation. The offspring are created to fill the full carrying capacity of the population, with the numbers per nest being equally divided among all surviving offspring. This allows the population to maintain a constant population size (prior to viability selection) while maintaining the relative successes of the given genotypes/morphs. 

### 5. Viability selection 

Before becoming adults, the offspring experience viability selection. Courters and parental males are disfavored in viability selection, with a survival probability of `r exp(-0.5/(2*50))`. If an individual is both a courter and a parental male, the survival probability is `r exp(-1/(2*50))*exp(-1/(2*50))`. Non-courters and non-parental males have survival probabilities of 1. 

### Evaluating equilibrium

After 10000 generations, I begin tracking the change in frequency of the courter and parent traits, and do so for 2000 additional generations. I calculate the variance in the change in frequency over those 2000 generations. I declare an equilibrium ('stasis') has been reached if the last change in frequency of both traits is less than the variance in changes in frequency. 

### Replicates

Using the parameter settings described below, I ran five independent instances of the model, each of which had four replicates spawned from identical starting conditions. This approach was chosen to reduce the effects of stochasticity in this type of model. In the multi-panel figures from the simulation model, each row contains the four replicates that originated with identical starting conditions. 


\newpage{}

## Overview of the mathematical model 

The mathematical model was designed with the same population of courters and non-courters and parents and non-parents in mind. In this version, I track the number of offspring produced at each step. 


![Flowchart of mathematical model](../figs/mathModel_Ns_diagram.png)


### 1. Establishing nests

The number of nests that can be created in the population is determined by the number of males that will be chosen by females. This is determined by the $w_s$ parameter, which in current settings is 1 for courters and 0 for non-courters. Each morph has a total reproductive effort (total number of sperm from that morph), $s_M$, which is the individual reproductive effort $r_M$ multiplied by the number of males of each morph. 

### 2. Fertilization

In the fertilization step, there are two components: the eggs males fertilize in their own nests ($e_o$) and the eggs fertilized in other males' nests through sneaking ($e_s$. Only courters are chosen by females, so only courters fertilize their own eggs (this is controlled by the ${w_s}_M$ term, which is 1 for courters and 0 for non-courters). 

The number of eggs fertilized by non-courters (${e_s}_M$) is dependent on the availability of nests. For that reason, ${e_s}_M$ is either the difference between the maximum number of offspring that can be produced by non-courters ($N_s$). This value is determined by the reproductive effort of non-courters (represented by $r_{NN}$), the total number of nests ($n$), and the number of sneakers per female ($num_{sneakers}$) weighted by the sperm competition coefficient ($c$).

### 3. Nest survival

Nests survive based on whether the male is a parent (it survives) or a non-parent (it does not survive). Males therefore have two types of offspring: those that survive in their own nests (if they are a courter) and those that survive in other males' nests (if they are a non-courter). 

### 4. Offspring survival

Offspring who are in surviving nests are subjected to (relatively weak) viability selection against the courter and parent traits, using the same selection coefficient as in the simulation model. This selection is multiplicative for courter-parents. 

### 5. Equilibrial results

The next generation's frequencies are determined by the frequency of the morphs that survive to adulthood. To investigate equilibrial outcomes, I performed numerical analysis over 100 generations. These results were saved from across a range of initial morph frequencies, reproductive contributions for male morphs ($r_M$), sperm competition coefficients ($c$) and number of sneakers that can fertilize each nest ($num_{sneakers}$). Interactive plots of the diversity of the population at the end of 100 generations can be viewed as [a shiny app](https://spflanagan.shinyapps.io/morph_predictions/).

```

## Low diversity parameter space

The [results from the mathematical model](https://spflanagan.shinyapps.io/morph_predictions/) were inspected to identify parameter regions where multiple morphs were *not* maintained. I focused on parameter sets when morphs had equal initial frequencies, as the simulation model initiates populations with nearly equal frequencies of the morphs. I selected the low diversity parameters in Table \@ref(tab:lowDivParams) to implement in the simulation model with a single locus underpinning the courter and parent traits. 

```{r lowDivParams}
highDivParams<-data.frame(
  parameter = c("r (in shiny app)",
                "r_CP",
                "r_CN",
                "r_NP",
                "r_NN",
                "c",
                "number of sneakers"),
  value = c( 2, 
             8,
             8,
             4,
             4,
             0.5,
             4)
)
kable(highDivParams, "latex",booktab=TRUE,
      caption="Table of parameters selected to create a low-diversity population. All morphs started at equal frequencies.")

```

Based on the mathematical model, we expected the courter-parent morph to dominate the population (Table \@ref(tab:lowMathResults)), and that it would dominate the population rapidly (Fig. \@ref(fig:mathOverTimeLow)). The same patterns are observed in the simulation model results (Fig. \@ref(fig:lowDivPlot)).

```{r lowMathResults}

                      morph_results$initial_CN == 0.25 &

## High diversity parameter space

The [results from the mathematical model](https://spflanagan.shinyapps.io/morph_predictions/) were inspected to identify parameter regions where multiple morphs were maintained. I focused on parameter sets when morphs had equal initial frequencies, as the simulation model initiates populations with nearly equal frequencies of the morphs. I selected the high-diversity parameters in Table \@ref(tab:highDivParams) to implement in the simulation model with a single locus underpinning the courter and parent traits. 

```{r highDivParams}
highDivParams<-data.frame(
  parameter = c("r (in shiny app)",
                "r_CP",
                "r_CN",
                "r_NP",
                "r_NN",
                "c",
                "number of sneakers"),
  value = c( 0.5, 
             4,
             4,
             8,
             8,
             0.5,
             4)
)
kable(highDivParams, "latex",booktab=TRUE,
      caption="Table of parameters selected to create a high-diversity population. All morphs started at equal frequencies.")

```

Based on the mathematical model, we expected the courter-parent, noncourter-parent, and noncourter-nonparent morphs to be maintained at reasonably high frequencies (Table \@ref(tab:highMathResults)). Interestingly, the polymorphism maintained in the mathematical model seems to be maintained through cyclical shifting of morph frequencies (Fig. \@ref(fig:mathOverTime)).

```{r highMathResults}
kable(morph_results[morph_results$initial_CP == 0.25 & 
                      morph_results$initial_CN == 0.25 & 
                      morph_results$initial_NP == 0.25 & 
                      morph_results$initial_NN == 0.25 & 
                      morph_results$r==0.5 &
                      morph_results$c == 0.5 &
                      morph_results$num_sneak == 3,
                    c("CP","CN","NP","NN")],

  if(all(is.na(output[i+1,]))){
    #then the population has crashed
    output[(i+1):(gens+1),]<-c(0,0,0,0)
    break
    
  }
}

```

The simulation model with the same parameter settings also resulted in polymorphism, especially when males were permitted to mate with multiple females (Fig. \@ref(fig:highDivPlot)). Surprisingly, few of the simulation runs resulted in the maintenance of all three predicted morphs.

```

These runs did not produce as much variation as I expected, and raised several questions:

1. What allows non-courter/parents to dominate in some cases, when they shouldn't be chosen as nesting mates by females?

2. What causes one or another sneaker morph to become present in the population?

3. What causes the variation among runs in terms of the outcomes?

The answers to these three questions are likely to be somewhat linked. 

## Addressing raised questions

First, I tried to understand what was allowing the non-courter/parents to dominate the monogamy models. In the model, females sample 50 males in the population and if they do not find a courter male, they will then mate randomly. This random mating is the only pathway through with non-courter/parent males should be able to mate, because only non-parents are sneakers. To ensure that this is the case, I ran the model turning off the random-mating option, so females do not successfully mate if they cannot find a courter male. In these runs we would expect the dominant morph in the population to be a courter/parent, which we see is the case (Fig. \@ref(fig:multipleMorphsNM)). This figure can be compared to Fig. (\@ref(fig:multipleMorphs)), and in doing so we see that under monogamous conditions the Non-Courter/Parent morph is displaced as the dominant one by the Courter/Parent morph. The polygynous cases are similar to the cases when females can mate randomly if they do not encounter an attractive male.  

```{r multipleMorphsNM,fig.cap="Stacked bar charts showing the frequencies of the four morph types in the final generation of each replicate. The top row are runs where males can only mate once and the bottom row are runs where males can mate with multiple females.

```

The monogamous result suggests that the number of mates a female can search is an important parameter in the model. I would expect that in the non-random mating scenario, the population would crash if I hadn't adjusted the model so that each generation is created in numbers proportional to the produced offspring to maintain a stable population size.

Next, I dug into the results to look into the relationship with initial frequencies to see how important those stochasitic differences in morph frequencies are in the outcomes. I somewhat expected that the initial frequencies might drive which morphs were found in the final runs. Fig. (\@ref(fig:FinalMorphsInitialTraitsThresh)) suggests that the initial conditions do differ, and therefore *could* play a role, but consistent patterns don't emerge. Therefore, I wanted to investigate the role of some of my other assumptions in the model.

Looking at the time-series of the frequencies of the morphs for one of the combinations that results in variation (polgyny, equal fitness, without allowing for random mating) -- which have variation showing up in a number of runs (Fig. \@ref(fig:eqFitness)) -- we see that the courter/parent morph rises to nearly a frequency of 1 within very few generations (Fig. \@ref(fig:timeSeriesFreqs)), but in some cases doesn't actually become fixed. If we focus only on the early generations (for instance, the first 50), we can see that in the runs that maintain small amounts of variation at the end, at least one of the morphs, but not necessarily the one that survives til the end, has a gradual rather than a sharp decline (Fig. \@ref(fig:timeSeriesFreqs50)).

If we narrow our attention to the final generations and the very small frequencies to focus in on the alternate morphs towards the end, it's clear that in some of these cases the different alternative morphs are trading off which one is persisting in the population (Fig. \@ref(fig:timeSeriesFreqsYlim)).

```

\newpage{}

While these investigations help understand some of what's driving the model, it's still unclear:

- what mechansims cause a gradual vs sharp decline in initial frequency

- what drives one alternative to persist rather than another

- why only one or two individuals can survive as alternative morphs


## Without viability selection

As Suzanne expected, if we have no viability selection, the courter/parent morph becomes fixed in the population.
